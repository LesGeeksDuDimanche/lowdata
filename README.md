# lowdata

This repository is design to gather tools and technics to reduce bandwith consumption during a sailing trip with sattelite communication (9kB/min).

This guide is mainly dedicated to OSX, but is is designed to give cross-plateform advice in the future

## Measuring

Measuring is the first step before regulating. Use the tool you have to diagnostic network consumption, like *Monitor* on *OSX*:

## Email

You should forget *Gmail* and its fancy web interface: it was 100 times (check the good ration) the amount of data you need to exchange email. Go back to a simple desktop mail application with POP/SMTP configuration (IMAP send unnecessessary synchronisation message) :

### Mail from OSX

This is my current configuration. I didn't manage to configure in text only yet: HELP WANTED!

### Thunderbird

TODO: Download and test

## Use Lynx for webbrowing

[Lynx](http://lynx.browser.org) is a text based web browser picture and javascript free that allow reducing the bandwith when browsing the web.

## Avoid DNS request

In order to reduce DNS request, there is two option:

- Using IP instead of name server => unfortunately, it doesn't work if you try to access a website using virtualhost
- Add common domain name to `/etc/hosts`. When looking for a domain name resolution, the system first look into this file to avoid DNS request

## Limit unwanted connection

### Close all app

Most of your application exchange data with a server. Keep only the one you need.

### Disable unnecessary services

## Reducing picture size

Sending picture is generally a bad idea when you have a 9ko/min bitrate. If you really need to, you should definitely reduce the size and choose the jpeg format (if you don't need transparency). [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org) is a simple command line tool dedicated to that.

### Installation

    brew install imagemagick

### Usage

    $ convert -quality 60 monitor.png  -resize 1104x monitor.jpg

Look at the size I spared for the above image:

    $ ls -l monitor.*
